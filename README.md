# Dish Diver
Dish Diver is an application for anyone looking for culinary inspiration. The frontend is built with React.js and the backend is built with Express.js and Node.js. It is powered by the [Edamam Recipe Search and Diet API](https://rapidapi.com/edamam/api/recipe-search-and-diet). The interactions with the Edamam API are handled using Axios and page routing is handled using React Router.

# Features
- Integration with External APIs: The app integrates with the Edamam Recipe Search API to fetch recipe data. The Edamam API calls are made from an Express.js backend server.

- Recipe Search: Users can search for recipes based on keywords or ingredients.

- Filtering Options: Users can filter search results by criteria such as cuisine type, dietary restrictions, and calorie range.

- Pagination: The app supports pagination to load more recipes beyond the initial results.

- Share Recipes: Users can share recipes with others.

- Recipe Details: Nutritional information such as calorie count, macronutrients, and diet labels are provided for each recipe.

# Next Steps
As I continue to work on Dish Diver, I am aiming to add user authentication, ability to bookmark and rate recipes, and fully responsive design.
